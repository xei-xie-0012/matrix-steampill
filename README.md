# easy163-dev

developer toolkit for everyday tasks

## why this exists

i needed something that just works without reading 50 pages of docs.

## install

```bash
npm i easy163-dev
```

## use it

```js
import tool from 'easy163-dev'
tool({ input: 'data.json' })
```

## tech

runs on poll, probably buggy

## limitations

- sometimes slow on large files
- not production ready

scratching my own itch
